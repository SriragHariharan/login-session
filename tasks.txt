Design a login and a home page - bootstrap & handlebars.

Login page should accept the username and password from the user.

The username and password should be validated on the server side with a predefined value.

If correct, give access to the home page. 

If incorrect, display an incorrect username or password message on the login page.

The home page should contain a signout button. On click signout button - redirect to the login page. 

Note: Session handling should work properly. Signout shouldn't happen unless the user presses the signout button. Also, once the user has signed out, the home page shouldn't be loaded on pressing the back button.
